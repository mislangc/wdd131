            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div id="profile">
                <p>My name is Carl Benedict Patague Mislang. I was born in the Philippines and
                    we live in Tarlac City. I'm studying at Brigham Young University Online and currently taking
                    Software Development. What I'd love to do during my free time is play the piano, listen to music,
                    video games and play with our dogs. My fascination for tech started when my father introduced me to
                    PS1. As I was trying different consoles as I grow up, I eventually arrived at a point of curiosity
                    of how this games were made. From this point, this led me to code and programming.</p>
